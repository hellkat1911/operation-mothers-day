    "description": "Neither your life nor your gathered intelligence will be at risk once you arrive at a quiet, secluded bed & breakfast for a weekend stay. While there are many within your operational theater, 10 Fitch in Auburn is an ideal candidate. No one will think twice about two people checking in for a weekend, and to protect your cover it's recommended you take advantage of several of the services provided by the establishment: European rain showers, Turkish bath towels, and in-suite massages. Your exfil officer will squeeze everything he can out of you during your stay.",

    "description": "With spring having arrived and warm weather on the horizon, touring a winery won't seem out of place to anyone attempting to track your movements. Bully Hill is renowned nation-wide for their excellent selection of wines with clever names and hand-drawn labels. AirBnbs are plentiful in the region, and you won't have an issue selecting one with your exfil officer. Once there, it's imperative that you try to enjoy yourself. Be warned: your companion officer is authorized to use force to ensure compliance with the debriefing protocol. A few bottles of Love My Goat Red might wet your lips enough to obviate the need for rough stuff... or not.",
